What are Connected Components in a Graph?

In graph theory, a connected component is a cluster of nodes where every node is reachable from every other node in that cluster, and there are no connections to nodes outside the cluster.

- If a graph is fully connected, it has just one component.

- If it’s disconnected, it has multiple components.

*Component 1: Nodes {1, 2, 3, 4} are connected together.

Component 2: Nodes {5, 6, 7} form another cluster.

Component 3: Nodes {8, 9} form the last cluster.

So this single graph has 3 connected components.

connected components are used in (social networks)

Network reliability (isolated subnetworks)
